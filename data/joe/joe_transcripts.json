    "response": "Joe Rogan podcast. Check it out. The Joe Rogan Experience. Train by day. Joe Rogan podcast by night. All day. A club where you sit down once a week and you pour through different articles, and the takeaway is most articles are, you know, crap. They're not, they're not, they're low power, or they're, um, conflicts of interest, or, you know, they're not, they're designed poorly. So, you know, my mindset coming into the pandemic was, you know, the research, the journals are a starting point, but it's not the final say. It's your own clinical experience and what you're seeing.",

    "response": "And, you know, we had never seen COVID before. Um, so we were learning on the fly, but, you know, I've never treated this many patients with a single disease in my career. And so you quickly become an expert, and, you know, doctor, I can't speak for all doctors, but we like to do well. We like our patients to get better. That's how sort of how you get job satisfaction is seeing your patients do well. So why would I, you know, continue to have, you know, COVID patients come in if I couldn't help them?",

    "response": "Um, and it's astounding to me that the doctors in the hospitals just didn't pivot, didn't try new things. And I guess they were handcuffed by, you know, the hospital administrators. But it just seems to me that, um, you know, there was a doctor in Houston, Joe Veron, who I'm pretty good friends with, who a critical care doctor, and he was one of the founders of FLCCC, which is sort of the, they developed the original protocols for ivermectin. Dr. Veron had much better success than most other doctors.",

    "response": "His overall success rate was 4.4% of his patients died, whereas in other hospitals average around 20%. And he did, he threw the kitchen sink at them at people, and he, he basically followed this FLCCC hospital protocol. So when the monoclonal antibodies were suppressed, what, what was the messaging like? They said that the strain of the virus was no longer covered, so that it had evolved and it wouldn't work. But at the same time, they're using the exact same vaccine. And they had switched the monoclonal antibodies periodically.",

    "response": "So it wasn't like they started with one and stuck with it the same the whole time. But it was really clear, and the propaganda was shocking because we've all seen propaganda with foreign conflicts, weapons of mass destruction, all that jazz. But when Rolling Stone magazine printed an article saying that people were, the hospitals were overflowing with people overdosing on ivermectin and gunshot victims couldn't get in, and then they used a stock photo which was of a bunch of people wearing winter coats in, like, I think it was, I think the article was August in Oklahoma.",

Like people that want to try different things, like, are you cra... people that were anti-vaccine or anti- anything. I'm like, these are the best people at the front of the line.

    "response": "The propaganda was disheartening, but it was that the whole system is compromised. And then when I found out that pharmaceutical drug companies are, they're the ones that are funding studies, and that they could have a whole ton of study, they don't have to divulge all the data from their studies. They only have to show you some studies that were carefully crafted to show efficacy. But all the other studies that they had that even showed negative effects, they could bury those. I was like, what is this? Like, what is this? It's, but it's like everything in the world when money gets involved.",

Well, in, um, you know, even last Friday, Vanity Fair did an article on Dr. Mary Talley Bowden and they quoted me in it, and in, you know, in their description of me, they used horse dewormer. Still, Katherine Eban, the reporter for Vanity Fair, and she buddied up to me, acted like we were good friends.",

I'm like, why you guys aren't concentrating on the fact that a 55-year-old man is fine three days later during the worst strain. It was during the Delta where everybody's freaking out.

Yeah. He was reporting his insane adverse side effect where he almost died. He was telling about it, and they labeled him a kook for that. Well, Malone, um, uh, Dr. Peter McCullough, but I'm...",

Dr. Peter McCullough is the most published physician in his field in human history. Like this is a incredibly well-respected doctor up until he took a moral and ethical stand saying that this is not what they're saying. This is not what we should be doing, and then destroyed. But the, the man has incredible courage, and he was labeled all kind...

But when you have indemnity, when when you have complete immunity for any financial liability like the vaccine manufacturers do, and all you have to do is label it a vaccine, right? They changed the definition for mRNA vaccine technology. That's why they don't get sued because we need vaccines. You know, and then, then unfortunately I read Robert F.

    "response": "And uh, I actually sued the FDA over that horse tweet, and we won. Um, it hasn't really changed anything, but so the FDA, when they put that information or misinformation out against Ivormect, they were really crossing a line because they're not allowed to tell the public you can't take a medication for this or you should take a medication for that. They're basically allowed to just approve medications and move on. I mean, they can issue a safety alert if there's something that comes up.

So, the reporter still used the term horse dewormer. Yeah. Wild, right? You're, you're still be able to horse push her in 2025. Right. Right.

    "response": "Um, but another thing the FDA I believe should do is make ivormectin over the counter because people are basically going to the feed store. I mean, my, my own kid, he had some sort of scabies situation um in Houston, Texas, over the weekend. 52% of the respondents said they go to the feed store to get their ivormectin. I mean, is there any difference in the ivormectin from the feed store? I mean, I haven't heard of anybody having issues, but it's just unnecessary. We should be able to get the medication very easily. And there is some sort of an efficacy for some sort of skin infections.",

We should be able to just go to, I mean, in Mexico, guy from India. That kind of worries me because you just, I just bought boxes, cuz I was handed out boxes to people because so many people were telling me they couldn't get it. Right. Right.

And then to stop monoconal antibodies, just stop them where you couldn't get them. My friend, uh, one of his buddies was in the hospital, and because he was in the hospital, they wouldn't give him monoconal antibodies. Oh, yeah.

And my theory is they probably had a massive inflammatory response because we would see that, that people would get the monoconal antibodies and they would just feel like complete hell that night because it was like a little war going on in the body, and then they would wake up the next day feeling great.

    "response": "So, you know, the second week of illness was the massive inflammatory response. So, I, my, my thinking is the monol antibodies may have just exacerbated that, but they could have counteracted that with with high-dose steroids, and that was another thing they gave these like pitly doses of steroids in the hospital, and what steroid steroids in particular, uh, methyl predinisolone or salumemed was what we typically used if we were in, is that prennazone, what I took, is that the same thing?",

    "response": "No, well, prennazone is an oral, there are different types, but um, like I usually do Medrol dose pack rather than prennazone because it's been shown to help better with respiratory. It's not a huge deal, but um, in the hospitals, they could give Solumedrol and high doses of that, but they were giving very small doses of steroid, which is a problem. Well, that's, that's also one of the things that they talked about in the RFK Jr. book, um, was that the studies that were saying that it was ineffective, the, the studies were not using the protocol that these doctors were using.",

Uh, that might have been, I can't remember, but around that time I had another, I had um, a father reach out to me. A 17-year-old um, had a history of a kidney transplant, and they were going to Europe, and they wanted to have ivermectin just in case he got sick. And I was talking to the dad and the stepmother. I didn't realize I wasn't talking to the mother. So the mother found out I prescribed him ivermectin and turned me in. Um, but ivermectin is um, metabolized by the liver, not the kidney. So it would be no harm for him to get, you know, as having had a kidney transplant for him to get ivermectin, and he never took the medicine, but it cost me $16,000 in legal fees to get that straightened out.",

They're going to tell me the truth.\" That's I thought I just automatically thought that, or they're at least saying what they're allowed to say.

They don't... they're not aware of the high percentage of them. I... What is it in the 30s? Well, yes, about 33%. Uh, they they looked at it over 10 years. 33% had significant safety warnings um, on the drugs, and it took about four years for those to become recognized. I mean, their drugs I used to prescribe that are no longer on the market. I mean, so yeah, like I said, it would have been any other drug would have definitely been pulled by now based on all the adverse events we've seen.

So if you have, you know, CO has its own little code and you can just dial in the code and get all the numbers. They have a code for vaccine hesitancy, but they don't have a code for injury.",

What what if you find out you have myocarditis and your life expectancy is greatly reduced and we know for a fact it came out of this vaccine. What do you give a person like that?

That they inadvertedly get gave these people this Simeon virus 40 which when it gets into the human body can lead to rapid cancer. Right.

Well, if you look at lip if you look at lipid nano particles and that's sort of the that's what otherwise if you just put mRNA into the body without the lipid nanoparticle it would get destroyed.

    "response": "So there have been um studies showing that there's excess DNA in these samples which shouldn't be there and that's just sort of this hard line that shouldn't be crossed. I think that's why Dr. Latapo has chosen this argument to go by. Um because there's just like a hard line that you don't cross and they have crossed that. The concern is does it integrate into your own into your cell's DNA? That's right. You imagine if we made like hybrid people, they turned out to look like Neanderls, you know, like we we injected them with something that twisted their their genes back.",

Uh I don't have a big support system of other specialists I can send them to. I mean, I don't feel sorry for myself, but I'm just saying it's just very different from what I'm used to as a doctor.

I'm sorry, but I hate... I mean, that happened. People, they give them morphine and insulin... and... Yeah. Yeah. That's common. Yeah. Yeah. I've... I've reviewed charts in this situation. Um, they gave her a DNR, which is do not resuscitate, meaning if they look like they're dying, you don't do anything, which that was not the case. So, they're suing for battery, which is one way of getting around the PREP Act because the PREP Act is very, um, hard to penetrate. The PREP Act protects everybody, all the doctors, all the hospitals from any wrongdoing during COVID. So, it's been this big challenge trying to get around the PREP Act. And this case has hope of getting around the PREP Act because they're charging for battery, and they're in trial. It started today. It's in Wisconsin.",

I mean, they'll justify giving morphine because they'll say, \"Oh, well, they're struggling to breathe.\" Well, guess what? Morphine actually depresses your drive to breathe. Um, but like this one case, I remember this patient, he was sick. He looked like he was dying, but they just like pushed morphine. He had no pain, you know, they do a pain score, so 0 to 10. This guy had zero pain. Uh, and then they pushed insulin to drop his sugar, and his glucose was fine. And then he died three minutes later. And you... I turned him into the medical board. I reviewed this chart and turned him in the medical board. Nothing. They didn't do anything. Uh, but yeah, they definitely... that definitely went on during COVID.",

I was like, \"Why would I do that? I don't even, why are you, what do you like? I really want to know, like, why would I do that? Well, they may think, you know, it's kind of like the flu.

I, I actually ended up with sepsis and I with the flu and in the ICU, and I'd gotten the flu shot. Not that, you know, but, but you always believed, assumed it was fine. Yeah.",

You 24% more likely to get sick. So, but it doesn't prevent you from getting the flu. Um, but the numbers are dismal because not everybody gets the flu. Right.

    "response": "I'm always on the verge of running out of gas, so I will not get a Tesla. Yeah, the charging is a pain in the butt.

Well, I mean, um I think in the future they're probably all going to be electric or some new fuel source. I heard that Porsche is working on some fuel source that is different than um just standard gasoline and it actually it has like insanely low emissions.",

I mean, that's the, that's the elephant in the room. Like, everything needs gas. Like this idea we got to get off petroleum products. Like when everything, everything's made with oil. Like we are a petroleumbased society. I'm, I think that's it.",

I don't like how the marketing of it. I don't like it. I don't like it. Uh, yes, you're reading that right. E- fuel is close to gasoline in its use, yet its production is much more environmentally friendly.

    "response": "First step is the electrolysis of water splitting it into two uh its two components hydrogen and oxygen gases in partnership with Simon's energy. Porsche simultaneously captures the carbon dioxide directly from the air and combines it with the hydrogen produced to synthesize methanol. The resulting synthetic methanol can then be used in Exon Mobile's methanol to gasoline process.

Renewable sources of electricity for the electrolysis. Well, it seems like uh this is their push to keep combustion engines because that's the number one problem that car enthusiasts have.

    "response": "They're amazing. The Porsche one is fantastic. Same as the Model S. They're the driving them makes other cars feel so stupid. But the problem is reselling them. You know, like people you lose a lot of value in it as opposed to like if you buy something, you know, like that it's like a BMW. Like say you buy a BMW M3 and then you want to get rid of it in two years. It doesn't lose much value. It's still a really valuable car that people want cuz it probably will behave the exact same way as the day you drove it off the lot, but you can get it now for cheaper. A little cheaper, but not a lot cheaper, right? But not with these e-cars, which is kind of crazy. Buddy of mine's kid got an Audi, like this sick Audi. I think it's called the Ron. He got it for like $60,000 and it was like a $120,000 car a couple years ago. Yeah. So, that's an issue. But, but how long are the batteries supposed to last?",

I think, I think him and Dane Cook had like a battle to see like who, who could do the longest set. I don't think Dave was like trying to battle, but I think Dade like took the title.

Really, we wanted to do that 10 years ago. And then my question was like, you guys are the pros. Like, I'm just my job as the director. I'm not chasing down bad guys. I don't know how to do that. Is to give them what you need and get the hell out of the way. And they were like, dude, all they did was get in the way.

And their long-term game is this. How do I, in my opinion, kneecap the United States of America, our largest adversary? Well, why don't we go and take out generations of young men and women who might grow up to serve in the United States military or become a cop or become a teacher? And that's what they're doing when you wipe out tens of thousands of Americans a year. It's a long-term plan for them.",

So, um, the fentanyl, a lot of it is, it's not just fentanyl overdoses, right? It's opiate overdoses overall. How much is a lot of it because people get hooked on pills and like, and then they want more, and then they buy black market pills, and those are the ones that have fentanyl in it, or is it Molly and things like that that have been laced with fentanyl?

    "response": "Private pathologist Dr. Michael Baden said the morning TV show Fox and Friends, Mr. Epstein experienced a number of injuries, among them a broken bone in his neck that are extremely unusual in suicidal hangings and could occur much more commonly in homicidal strangulation. I think the evidence points to homicide rather than suicide, said Dr. Baden, who observed the autopsy done by city officials. Dr. Baden, a former New York City medical examination and a Fox News contributor, said, \"I have not seen in 50 years where that occurred in suicidal hanging case.\"",

    "response": "Uh, findings by Dr. Baden were strongly disputed by the city's chief medical examiner, Dr. Barbara Samson, who previously ruled that Mr. Epstein's death on August 10th in the Metropolitan Correctional Center was a suicide. I stand firmly behind our determination of the cause and manner of death in this case. Dr. Samson said in the interview on Wednesday, she added, \"In general, fractures of the hyoid bone and cartilage can be seen in suicides and homicides.",

You could see why very powerful people wouldn't want if he was murdered in segregated housing in isolation after being on suicide watch in a place in a detention center that I physically been in myself. It would be fiction. It's just in in my experience that is not doable. It's not doable. Even for the most powerful and wealthiest people in the world. Yeah.

And the one thing I'll tell you about prison systems is the... the people they eat are child predators. Yes. And he was going to get eaten. Well known. Yeah.

I don't I think it's I always say this. I think it's dismissive to say those people were incompetent.

And I'm glad it's everywhere because for me it highlights the multiple levels of operation that our adversaries are looking to do harm on us.

I can't remember exactly who off the top of my head got it, if there was some of them or none of them or what happens, but that's never happened before in the history of the country.

    "response": "These people that that used to run the FBI are coming in there and they would have made the same decisions. It's just the fact that we're making them and they got fired because they got caught conspiring against the United States of America and weaponizing the FBI and CNN's given them a platform.

When you see these articles when they're talking about quantum computing and some of the researchers are equating it to the multiverse, they're saying that the ability that these quantum computers have to solve these problems very quickly seems to indicate that it is in contact with other realities.

You have local simulations. Maybe they're testing to see if we're dumb enough to create superintelligence. Whatever it is, it makes sense as a theory, but I cannot experimentally prove it to you.",

    "response": "So I'm trying to, the technology we have today and project forward. I did it with AI. Let's do it with virtual reality. We are at the point where we can create very believable, realistic virtual environments. Maybe the haptics are still not there, but in many ways, visually, sound-wise, it's getting there. Eventually, I think most people agree, we'll have the same resolution as our physics. We're also getting close to creating intelligent agents. Some people argue they are conscious already or will be conscious. If you just take those two technologies and you project it forward, and you think they will be affordable one day, a normal person like me or you can run thousands, billions of simulations, then those intelligent agents, possibly conscious ones, will most likely be in one of those virtual worlds, not in the real world. In fact, I can again retro-causally place you in one. I can commit right now to run a billion simulations of this exact interview.",

    "response": "Mhm. So the chances are you're probably in one of those. But does that make sense? Because if this technology exists, and if we're dealing with superintelligence, so if we're dealing with AI, and AI eventually achieves superintelligence, why would it want to create virtual reality for us and our consciousness to exist in?

Especially if we look at the scaling forward of technology from MS-DOS to, you know, user interfaces of like Apple, and then what we're at now, quantum computing, and these these sort of discussions.

There are some arguments about kind of self-sustaining simulations where no one's running them externally, just the nature. But I honestly don't fully comprehend how that would happen. Yeah, the holographic universe and the concepts of human consciousness has to interact with something for it to exist in the first place. That's one also.

And the conclusion is basically, if it's smart enough, it will eventually escape. It will break out of the box. So, it's a good tool. It buys you time, but it's not a permanent solution. And we can take it to the next level. If it's smart enough, will it kind of go, \"Oh, you're also in a virtual box?\" And either show us how to escape or fail to escape.

Like, if you want to really motivate someone, you have to have evil tyrants in order for you to justify having this insane army filled with bombers and hypersonic missiles. Like, you, you, if you really want progress, you have to be motivated. I, I think at some point we stop fully understanding how bad things are. So, let's say you have a pain scale from zero to infinity. I think you should stop at a 100. It doesn't have to be billion and trillion. It's not adding additional learning signal.",

Well, that's what a lot of people think the aliens are, right? Could be us visiting. But then again, if they're running a simulation, you don't have to physically show up in a game.

We're like, \"That seems like horseshit.\" So, that horseshit's kind of gone away. But the UFO horseshit still around because you have anecdotal experiences, abductees with very compelling stories.

I think it actually makes people less aware that they exist and it makes them, it, it, it stops all of the very valuable construction of arguments against these bad ideas. You have community notes, you have other people commenting, responding. So 100% for free speech. That's wonderful. But that was a problem we kind of knew how to deal with.

My understanding is he thinks if it's from zero principles, first principles, it learns physics, it's not biased by any government or any human, the thing it will learn is to be reasonably tolerant. It will not see a reason in destroying us because we contain information. We have biological storage of years of evolutionary experimentation. We have something to contribute.

How do I know other than someone told me?\" Like, you have to kind of examine how you come to your own conclusions. And I do that a lot. Like in the shower, I'll just kind of stand there. It's really like we all have a weird showering method. And I just kind of stand there with my hands like this. It's bizarre. It's like womblike.

They, they didn't trust the Iranians, and they wanted to make sure that these guys were gone. Yeah. They, they essentially killed everybody that he was, uh, negotiating with.

International reactions like the UN and the Oman condemning the strikes as undermining diplomacy support this view. However, Israel justified the attack as a preemptive strike against Iran's nuclear program, citing its non-compliance with the IAEA. No direct evidence proves intent to stop peace and the focus on nuclear sites suggest security concerns drove the action. The issue remains debated with perspectives varying by geopolitical stance.\"",

I was just, it was, it was during, during the lawsuit. It was a really bad time for me and I, I kind of felt badly. She thought I didn't like her, but I was just, but anyway, for two years it was phone stalking, and it was not scary like it would be for a woman, just annoying, but it becomes a part of your life, like you become, like this is with the old iPhones. So I would always get these, I would leave LA on a red eye, and I would land and my, my iPhone would be filled with voice messages. Oh boy.

I've been [ __ ] up for years. I've had, like, my leg goes numb. My right leg was going numb in my thigh. Um, did you ever get your back looked at? I did. I have to get again.

    "response": "Well, it depends on what you're taking. If you're taking a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, they're terrible for your gut... your gut biome. It destroys your gut biome. It's... it could be really bad. It can actually make inflammation. Like my friend Cam Haynes, he was taking 800 milligrams of ibuprofen every day. And I talked to him about it. I go, \"What you doing? What?\" And then I sent him some stuff that Rhonda Patrick had put out about it. I'm like, \"Dude, get off of that.\" He got off of it. All of his pain went away. The inflammation was being caused by the fact that he was taking so much ibuprofen. It was ruining his gut biome. So, it was creating inflammation. So, to combat that inflammation, he was taking ibuprofen. And he thought the only way he was going to be able to run the miles that he was running was to constantly chew on ibuprofen. So he got off of it entirely. All the pain went away. Totally counterintuitive.",

I have to think you're right because there was one time we had D'Rosa on the show. It was in the morning show, and he didn't bring us any sandwiches.

But I think those [ __ ] moments where a guy is like at nine, you know, if 10 is checkmate, he's at nine twice, that's big, man. that you don't want to be there. That guy got you there. He's got a [ __ ] locked in triangle. Yeah, you got out of it, but still that that's big, man. That should count. And damage leading up to a KO or that doesn't lead to a K.O is very significant in the scorecards, but a submission that doesn't lead up to a submission doesn't count. And I don't understand that. You can't just count damage. You have to count like near falls or near near subs.",

    "response": "I mean, if you if you want to take for example too, like even like a me and a TJ fight, like TJ was limping out of that cage and I was kind of, you know, like, oh, cool. You know, and I don't think that that should count for everything. But like you're saying, like the reason that he was limping out of that cage is because I popped his knee really bad, you know, like he had to spend the next 18 months making his knee better so that he could fight again. And I was able to fight, you know, pretty shortly afterwards. So, yeah, there's got to be something to that. like if you pop someone's [ __ ] really bad, it it should count just as much as a knockdown or something like that. What do you think about the idea of uh like 108 rounds for like things that are known, not just like, okay, this person won by a mile, but it's like in kickboxing they do if you get knocked down in a round, it's automatically a 108 round. You like that for M&amp;A or No,",

    "response": "I do. But if a guy is tuning you up for like the entire round and you clip him and drop him and he gets back up and he's still okay, I don't think that's a 108 round. I think I think MMA should be a completely different scoring system than the 10-point must system because I think the 10 we just stole this boxing system which is a great system for boxing because you only have two weapons and you only have your hands. You don't even have elbows, right? So, think about all the different factors in MMA and we're limited to 10 points. To me, that seems silly. I think it should probably be 10 points for each aspect of the sport. Like, okay, who who landed more kicks, who landed more punches, who and then calculate all that [ __ ] up together, you know, who had more takedowns, who who landed damage from the top. Add all it should be a comprehensive system. And I think there should be more than three judges, you know,",

    "response": "When you know when you have a split decision and like some of them are so crazy, you know, you see like a five-round split decision and it's they gave like four judges or three two out of the three judges rather give like three out of five rounds and the other person gives them the whole five rounds. Like this is too much variability. And and if you're a fighter, especially in MMA, because of the win bonus, which also drives me crazy, I think you if you had three more judges, so if you have six judges, six judges would balance it out.",

It's like there's so many fights where did you see the the past the Azerbaian fight? No, I watched Curtis's fight and a guy named Muhammad's fight on my team, but no, I didn't watch the other ones.

Just kept covering and moving and just getting bombed on to the body and to the head, but he kept it looked like it was getting close to stop and all he comes back and you see Mo's taking these big deep breaths and woo it was wild.

There's the thing that happens with golf is it takes so much time and it's so addictive that it's going to take away time from other stuff no matter what you do.

Jon Jones said he need needed six months to prepare for Aspenol if he's going to fight Aspenol. So they were trying to make a deal and then he decided to retire.

So, go talk to someone, a friend, your partner, family, a therapist. Therapy is an excellent tool everyone should utilize.

When you're a guy like Jamie, you know, you're whack like Jaime's got a simulator out there, so he's whacking balls every day.

You know, when I was out there, I was like, I could stay here forever. I was like, I'll stay. I was like, [ __ ] home. I was like, we can we afford this? I was like, let's just stay here.

People like traveling. It makes me feel like my life is moving on fast forward, which I don't really like.

Um, but it's been like useful stuff like seeing family and then like me and my wife going on our honeymoon or whatever.

Um, like I won't do that outside of camp unless I got a guy that's been giving me a bunch of rounds in my camps and he has a fight coming up and and then I'll like gear up to give him a good one, you know? But, uh, no, outside camp comp like just less competitive. I don't show up as early and get my mind right before when I'm in camp. Every single sparring session that I do, I try to put myself in the locker room while I'm warming up. Um, I think that that's like I've had a lot of success doing that.

Like I I kind of like live in a way where everything is my responsibility and if I [ __ ] up, it was like on me regardless of what happens, which is like a fine way to be, but also it's not like crazy realistic either. Um, but that's just kind of the way that I am, just the way that I grew up. like it was kind of like take care of me type of thing, you know, and if I'm messing stuff up, it's on me.

The only guys that I feel like can beat me at 50/50 are guys that train at 50/50. Um, and so it's kind of like what it feels like 50/50 the position and just kind of leg locks in general if you really know how to do them in MMA. Um, are a spot that you can pull people into and have them be completely lost. Um, because they have to think, what do I do now? And you're already moving.",

I can pull people into these really niche spots um where I where I know that I'm going to win them. Um so 50/50 is one of those. It's kind of like what jiu-jitsu used to be a little bit before people have started to understand jiu-jitsu, but now people fully understand jiu-jitsu, so you don't really get to like catch people in guillotines or whatever. But 50/50 and a lot of the leg locks and a lot of stuff that Ryan teaches me and does is so niche that like you would need an absolute expert to understand it.

But the disillusionment of going from taekwondo to boxing and kickboxing and then to Muay Thai and then jiu-jitsu. So when I started doing jiu-jitsu, I was like, \"Oh my god, I'm completely helpless.\" So I had this thing in my head, well at least I know I know how to leg kick.",

And I would say that if you're starting, you don't need to be like super stellar at both, but just have a couple good attacks to do from your other stance and then just like build off of there or whatever. I got I started switching stances. One because I really liked watching Nanito Daire, um, who wouldn't like fully switch, but he would have like kind of steps like that that where I was like, \"Oh, cool.\" And then also I dislocated my elbow really bad about like a week and a half into training, just landed on it, posted, dislocated it, and so I could only, or that was my left arm, so I could only use my right arm. So, for like six months, I just went lefty and only used my right arm, um, as like my lead hand. And that's how I got really good at it.",

I was probably like the the gay guy at the gym a little bit, you know, like being kind of flamboyant and like show offy. And uh so so I remember going with some of Sour's good guys and just good guys that we would spar with, and I wouldn't really get hit that much, and I was like, \"Oh [ __ ] this like actually works.\" Like this isn't just some like fufu whatever stuff, you know?",

I know you know this, but for people who don't know, Dwayne has like a notebook like [ __ ] just filled with notes, and it's all like he's got systems. Yeah.

Um, if I just keep my hands up, whatever, it'll be fine probably, you know. So, a lot of squared stance stuff is I'm just going to cut left, right, overwhelm this person with all of my weapons and angles, and always constantly make them move off of the things I'm doing and not the other way around. That's good, but it's really hard to uh like get a ton of leverage in anything that you're doing when you're standing square. Like I can't like if I'm going to throw a ball, I don't throw a ball like this, right? I throw a ball like this.",

    "response": "Right. You have your shoulder behind the other shoulder. Yeah.

    "response": "In a bladed stance, you get a fuckload of leverage because if you watch Ilia, he's always standing like he's about to throw a javelin. And that's pretty much what he's doing is just like, and this is kind of like the science of boxing a little bit, like I said, that Trevor helped me with. So, I'm a lot more bladed now than I was because now we're trying to get like some serious leverage on stuff because five round fights, moving the entire time, fighting these really good wrestlers, it can get to the point where it's like it just gets quirky and just like a little [ __ ] looking, you know, and like I don't really want to like tap people to victory, you know?

I think finding a balance between the two is really awesome. Elia is like only, and that's just my expression of my martial arts. I want to be like the jack of all trades, guys, and be able to be like, \"Oh, you're that style. I'll just archetype you in this style.\" But Elia is like always ready to throw a javelin, and he's really good at closing space with his lead leg. Like uh he'll like jab, hook, and really creep his lead leg near and then just bomb a right hand because he is a shorter guy, but he never seems like he's having that much of an issue getting super inside.",

I don't know what roof he cuts, but when I see him walking around, he looks like he's 190 lb. You know, like Islam. Islam's [ __ ] huge. He's big, dude.

It's a wrap.\" As soon as he gets on top and then he starts clamping down and squeezing, and guys are just like Olive was tapping like the moment it was on, he was like, \"Fuck this.\" Yeah.

This, you know, and you're not going to get inside of mine.\" I can feel strong as [ __ ], you know. Um, and yeah, those types of guys, they're just so used to being so compact and never letting anyone get inside their arms or wherever it is that they need to get that it's just it's like impossible to feel like you can move them.

You want to fight like a certain category of fighter who you're comfortable fighting, but you don't want to fight the guys that are tough and that are saying that you're going to win.

The real fight would have been Jon Jones versus Francis.

And when they were in control and they were silencing things, I think the attitude was this is good because we're right and we need to stop these fascists or whatever you want to call them, you know. And but the problem is then what if the [ __ ] right gets in place and they use the same rules that you used on them. Now we don't have a country anymore. Now we're [ __ ].

It was went back to when you didn't have to get signed by the contender or anything. They just would call you up on a day, but you kind of had to have a little bit of an in or be doing really well or something. So, um, yeah. So, that was like my first big experience with that.

And just whether it's in our imagination or not, cuz I'm still not fully bought into any of that stuff. Like I don't have any beliefs is what I say now.

Uh, cuz, you know, in addition to driving, he also flies the uh, uh, helicopter and he told me like the Red Bull guys were like flying off and there's like this big tournament. I looked it up.

We're playing together because I feel like for me, it helped me a lot with like strategy thinking, with reaction time. I think like gamers tend to be can think, think really fast.

Isn't the army also recruiting from gamers today as well? That's what I heard. Imagine like drone pilots, right?

    "response": "Although there's all the stock of startups in Silicon Valley and, and all of that, but in reality there's less entrepreneurship than there used to be, and instead we have the system of conglomerates and really big companies and uh, monopsiny, which is the idea that um, like there the, the banks or BlackRock, like owning competitors as well, owning all these companies, and they implicitly collude because they have the same owners, and all of that is, is sort of anticompetitive.

It has like all these amazing colors and does all these amazing things and kids get used to it very quickly, but it doesn't invite you to, to program it, and and and therefore we, we kind of lost that sort of hacker ethos.",

    "response": "There's less programmers, less people who are making things uh, because they got into it organically. It's more like they go to school to study computer science because someone told them you have to study computer science. And I think making software needs to be more like a, like a trade.

You know, if, if something happens, if you know, if I go to the mechanic and he's you doing work on my car, I know he's not going to scam me because I can understand what he's doing.

So, Roger Pinrose says these paradoxes that are not really resolved in mathematics and, and machines are, are no problem for humans, and therefore his sort of like a bit of a leap is that therefore there's something special about humans and we're not fundamentally a computer.

I think it's a completely different thing. It's really hard to get addicted to them, right? I mean, you could get, you could certainly get psychologically addicted to experiences. And I think there's also a real problem with people who use them and think that somehow or another they are just from using them gaining some sort of advantage over normal society.",

    "response": "Yeah. Let's get back to what everyone really agrees on in like the uh foundations of America, whether it's the Constitution or the culture. I think everyone believes in transparency, transparency of government, right? Yes. You know, here everything is transparent, like, you know, court cases and and and everything, right? Like more than any other place in the world. And so why shouldn't government spending not be transparent? And uh, we have the technology for it. I think one of the best things that Doge could have done and maybe still could do is have some kind of ledger for all the spend of of at least the nonsensitive sort of spend and and government.",

Well, people don't want to say it unfortunately because they don't want Elon to be correct because Elon has become this very polar polarizing political figure because of his connection to Donald Trump and because a lot of I mean there's a lot of crazy conspiracies that Elon rigged the 2024 elections. There's like, you know, everyone gets nuts. And then there's also the discourse on social media which half of it is at least half of it is fake. Half of it Bots. Yeah.",

I go to the profile, and the profile is like a name with like an extra letter and a bunch of numbers. I'm like, oh, you're a bot. 100%. How many of these are out there?

I think, you know, historically, state actors were the only, um, entities that are able to flood social media with, with, with bots that can be somewhat believable to like change opinions.

    "response": "It didn't even come about until essentially like 2007ish, right? I would say, yeah. Twitter 2006, 2007, Facebook before that, but Facebook wasn't really social media. Facebook was like an address book, a friends, uh, network, uh, but I think, uh, when I was at Facebook, there was this big push to become more of a social media around 2012, 13, so I would say it really ramped up in response to the success of Twitter. Yeah. And then they've tried with Threads, which is just pretty much a failure, right? Yeah. Less people than Blue Sky, right? I think like some fitness influencers probably.",

I think I have it set up like that. I, and maybe, maybe I think it's fitness influencers is because that's who I follow. Like Instagram for me is just to like go look at people lifts so I can go get excited. There's a value to like David Goggins post when he's running on the in the [ __ ] desert and he looks at you.

Oh, 100%. What's been really interesting is watch tyrron, um, talk [ __ ] on, uh, Twitter using AI videos. Like this is bizarre. They're talk like, hi Israel, like show like a nuclear bomb going off.

I, I think there's, you know, there's some of this investigative journalism that is not real time that, uh, that some, there's some reporters that are still good at it, but a lot of them moved to Substack as well, like...

You're there's a lot of opportunity for you to reskill and start using AI to like automate a big part of your job. And yes, there's going to be job loss, but I think a lot of those people will be able to reskill. And what we're doing with the government of Saudi Arabia, I would love to do in the US.

And like companies like OpenAI, which I love, but they go to like smaller startups and give them $10 million to grab their talent.",

    "response": "But, um, uh, but you know, it's uh, it's very, very competitive right now, and there are, like, I don't know if these individuals are actually worth these billions of dollars, but the talent war is so crazy because everyone feels like there's a race towards getting to super intelligence, and the first company to get to super intelligence is going to reap massive amounts of rewards.

Um, but the, the definition of super intelligence is that it is better than every other human collectively at any task. Um, and I, I am not sure there's evidence that we're headed there. Again, I think that one important aspect of super intelligence or AGI is that you drop this entity into an environment where it has no uh, idea about that environment.",

    "response": "It's never seen it before, and it's able to efficiently learn to achieve goals within that environment. Right now, there's a bunch of studies showing like, you know, GPT U 4 or any of the latest models, if you give them an exam or quiz that is slightly, even slightly different than their training data, they tank. Uh, I, I think the way that AI will continue to get better is via data. Uh, now at some point, and maybe this is the point of takeoff, is that they can train themselves. Uh, and the way they could, the way we know how AI could train itself through a uh, method called self-play.",

AlphaGo is, um, I'm sure you remember Lisa Dole, uh, a game between DeepMind AlphaGo and Lisa, and it won in the game of Go. Um, the way AlphaGo is trained is that part of it is a neural network that's trained on existing data. But the way it achieves superhuman uh, performance in that one domain is by playing itself like millions, billions, perhaps trillions of times.",

This is a really interesting thing that people could use at the gym though, like not just for squats, but maybe for chin-ups and all kinds of stuff like, oh, maybe, you know, I'm looking at your form and this is what you need to do, get a little lower, you know, make your elbows parallel to your body, whatever.",

And and it is it is valuable, but technique is the most valuable. And the best way to acquire technique is to pretend that you don't have any strength. The best way to acquire technique is pretend to... yeah, don't force things, just find the best path, and that requires a lot of data, so you have to understand the positions, you know, so you have to really analyze them. The best jiu-jitsu guys are really smart, like uh, Mikey Musumeci, Gordon Ryan, Craig Jones, those are very intelligent people, and that's why they're so good at jiu-jitsu.

Managing your mind is an intelligence in and the ability to override those emotions to conquer that inner [ __ ] that comes to you every time I lift that [ __ ] lid off of that coal plunge.

    "response": "Uh, basically uh, CBT is like a way to uh, get over depression and anxiety based on self self talk and and cues. Um, I I had to use it again. I had like sleep issues.

Uh, so you don't, first of all, you you insomnia is performance anxiety.

Whereas the UFC, you look at like, oh, look who's fighting first fight of pay-per-view. There's five fights on pay-per-view. First fight of pay-per-view is a banger. And everybody's the seats are packed and everybody's excited to see it.

But, and I think you're 100% correct, Joe, but isn't it in a perverse way a part of his mystique?",

But uh yeah, Roy loved all other fighters and he did what he could to help with Mlullen. I know that that loss that Mlullen had in the subsequent medical issues, the stroke and the aneurysm, all that stuff really disturbed Roy and made him think, you know, about getting out early.",

It was insane. It was so crazy. But that was his talent was insane. But it was also like he was just showing people. He was kind of playing with his food.

And then you've got a guy like Tarver who's infinitely talented and has legitimate knockout power and is talking [ __ ] to you right before the fight. Got any excuses tonight, Roy? Remember that? And then he knocks him out like holy [ __ ] with a brilliant straight left hand against the ropes. I can see it in my mind. Yeah.

Michael Moore. Yeah. Yeah. He was Southpaw. But again, another won the championship. Yep. Another light heavyweight and lost it to my man George Foreman. That one punch. Yeah, that was crazy. Yeah.

    "response": "Where, where I came up with It Happened! So, he was the expert commentator in the weeks leading to his fight with Mo. He and I together had called Mer against Holyfield when Mur won the championship. And in the weeks before he fought Mer, I would pull him aside at crew meals and, um, fighter meetings and other occasions when I could get a minute with him. Three, four times I asked him, \"George, how are you going to beat Mura? He's a southpaw. He's a mover. He has great feet. Holyfield couldn't find him. And Holyfield was much faster than you.\" And every time I said it, George would fix me with that implacable George Foreman gaze and say, \"Jim, you watch. There will come a moment late in the fight. He will come and stand in front of me and let me knock him out.\" Always the same words. He will come and stand in front of me and let me knock him out.",

But we've already talked about Tarver and, and Mura was another one who had punching power. Uh, and it's, you know, kind of Cooney. Cooney was a southpaw with punching power.",

Then all a sudden everything's reverse and now you're thinking, right? And if you don't have a lot of southpaws that you train with on a regular basis, things aren't automatic anymore.",

    "response": "It's a bad sport to be overconfident in. It's the worst sport. Whether you're talking UFC or boxing, yeah, any combat sport, when you don't appreciate the potential that your opponent has to do damage, well, I used to say to people all the time, these are fine margins of competition. You think you see a lot of wipeouts in boxing because you see a second-round knockout or third-round knockout, and you think that means there's a huge talent gap between the two fighters. No, it means one fighter made a mistake. Okay? 90% of the time, it means one fighter made a mistake. And if he thinks about it and trains against it, he won't make that mistake again. So, like a perfect example, Juan Manuel Marquez versus Pacquiao, 100%. They have three insane fights that are very close. Marquez lands one bomb and starches Pacquiao. This one error.

Uh, and and um, and so, you know, I'm I'm thinking that every fighter reaches a point where enough. Yes.

I remember I told the story. There was a news piece, um, when he was training on the Cape, and it was in the middle of the winter, and he was fighting Mustafa Ham Show, and he was running down the sand dune screaming war with combat boots on in the winter, and I remember thinking war, cuz you think you're disciplined, you think you're driven, you think, you know, you're special, and you see a guy like that, he's like, he's what my friend David Gogggins calls uncommon amongst uncommon.

And um, Cotto's little brother, Jose, caught uh Canelo with a right-hand body punch to the chest, and Canelo hit the ropes behind him and bounced off the ropes kind of unbalanced. He didn't go down, but he came off the ropes ungainly, unbalanced, etc., and the referee, and I can't remember which referee, stepped in and very technically ruled that the ropes had held him up.

This kid is not only going to be the biggest attraction in boxing, he's going to be the biggest attraction in American culture if he can keep coming up with quotes like that.\" And of course, within the next few weeks, they all started spilling out.

I also think he's one of those guys that if you tell him he can't do something, he wants to show you in shock. Thousand%. Absolutely right. I also think Canelo is slowing down and Canelo is a more of a one punch fighter now than the combination fighter he was when he was younger. We'll see. Not not yet ready to subscribe totally to that because again, you're talking about somebody who is stubborn and who wants to prove everything he can prove.",

    "response": "100%. I agree with that, too. But I think there's a there's a like in boxing and certainly in MMA, there's a certain amount of years where a fighter can keep the RPMs up and you know when you're in the red line and I there's there's some people subscribe to the idea of nine years. There's nine years is the most that a elite fighter in MMA has performed at their prime. I think that's a [ __ ] number because I think it's entirely dependent upon lifestyle, nutrition, discipline, physical attributes.

And so Mike had known Lennox for a long, long time uh by the time they met June 8, 2002 in uh Memphis.

Used to run into Chepo, his senior trainer at the grocery store. I'd look into the cart and say, \"Oh, he's he's eating tuna.\" And he said, \"Yes.\" And and he's eating chicken. Da da da. And um and so I also used to go down the hill from my house off of Via Debay in uh Delmare and watch him train at the equestrian center where he would go to the equestrian center in the morning and do two and a half hours of hunter jumper riding before going to his gym in the afternoon to do three and a half hours of boxing training.",

His volume volume was the real key because his power shots did not look like hellacious power shots. Okay. His left hook didn't look all that devastating.

So many of these people who have never had a psychedelic experience, have never really confronted their own reality in that way. How many of them would change their ways? I would imagine a great deal. You bring up a very important point that I've been thinking about a lot. We talk about using psychedelics and psilocybin and other substances for treating people who have trauma, you know, mental illness, you know, addiction issues. But what about prevention?",

You know, I think we're on a path if you look at where we stand with marijuana, for instance. Like look at Las Vegas is a great example because I remember in the '90s and when we would go to Las Vegas for the UFC in the, I guess, I guess actually it was in the 2000s. It was highly illegal, and you know, I'd remember the stories from the '70s where people were locked up for their entire lives for, you know, like an ounce of marijuana in Vegas. They had zero tolerance for it. And I always wondered what that was about, whether that was an anti-hippie thing or whether it was in response to the alcohol lobby. Vegas obviously sells a lot of alcohol and anything that would cut back on their profits. You know, this was, we talked about this the other day. The study showed that amongst young people, alcohol consumption is down significantly. Isn't it down by like 25%?",

This has revolutionized the field of biology. I think it's revolutionizes bringing children and young people back into nature. And you then you build a community. You're not talking about politics, you're talking about nature. And what did you find? And holy moly, I never knew there's a blue mushroom or something like that. So, it's um it's inspiring to see the kids get so excited about this and adults. And so, this is, you know, I'm",

    "response": "That's very cool. Yeah. Very cool. How many new species get discovered? Thousands and thousands. There's 223 known species of psilocybin mushrooms and about I'd say 10, 10 of them in the past two years has come from uh citizen scientists, quote unquote amateurs who found it, who uploaded it to high naturalists. And so if they find a new species, like how do they determine what if it's a completely new species? How do they determine that it's psilocybin? How do they determine where it's from?",

    "response": "Excellent question. Um, the psilocybin species localized in the genus Psilocybe, which is has the most psilocybin species. We just know from genetic associations if they're in the clay, the group that has psilocybin species, and the DNA analysis shows that they fit right into this cluster, then we have high confidence. But if a mushroom has gills, you know, and and it bruises bluish and has purple brown spores, those three things need to be true. Then 95% probability is a psilocybin mushroom. What species it is becomes more debatable. But psilocybin mushrooms are very hard to find with the exception of the golden top and there's another called pineal cinosins. They're growing pastures. They're easier to find. But most of these psilocybin mushrooms are hidden in the landscape.",

    "response": "How so? Well, I just had a 70-year-old man write me from Vermont and he has found Psilocybe serbica, and he wrote a classic letter to me that many people have written. I have looked for these mushrooms for years. I couldn't find them. And then I found a few, and I looked around, and they were everywhere. They're hiding in plain sight. And so now he knows with Psilocybe serbica in Vermont, he knows. It's just I can't believe how obvious they are to me and how unobvious they were to me before.

People don't see morelss and they find one or two and then suddenly they jump out of the landscape. It's how your brain works with pattern recognition.

The one but a few of them are. And this example here, the one that clearly is and and and in the mat tradition is called um it's called synratism. When you have a foreign influence, in this case a religion coming into an indigenous people, they merge and they still continue their indigenous practices under the umbrella of protection in this case of Christianity. But in the midc tradition, they believe the tears of Christ is where the mushrooms would appear. They believe the mushrooms were the body of Christ and therefore you'd never boil them. You never because you'd be hurting the body of Christ. So you only eat them raw or dried.",

And the great Maria Sabina was a devout Catholic and when she did her psilocybin ceremonies, she had the holy trinity. So that's another example where under the umbrella and from a survival point of view, culturally it makes sense. um and they adapted but they found that this sort of merging of indigenous uh practices and knowledge of psilocybin and Christianity was very compatible. M just was published um I think two weeks ago at New York uh university in John's Hopkins they had 24 uh clergy from from different faiths Christianity Buddhism Judaism uh and Muslims and they had them come in and they did a high doses of psilocybin and they had one group that had delayed didn't do it for 6 months and the other group did a high dose of psilocybin. It all each of those faiths the use of salicide mushrooms reinforced their belief in their faith.",

And so that natural culture technique of collecting cow patty. So cows go to ponds to drink. The blue lot lotus grows in ponds. The blue lotus is blue. The psilocide mushrooms turn blue. The mushrooms are golden in color. Gold and blue colors are sacred in Egyptology in ancient Egyptian culture. So now I was not the first person to discover this.

It's essentially they're explaining that these godly, holy people were under the influence of psilocybin. You know, I think what we can't and not just me, what we can't prove some of these ideas today. What we can prove is like the the John's Hopkins New York University study that religious belief systems are enhanced through the use of psilocybin which totally makes it makes sense. So we we can argue about the past but we can't we have really good scientific methodology now for analyzing the effects of psilocybin and it's profound. It's profound.",

We can inform, inform artificial intelligence how to be better to keep human, you know, community and psychology and and to propel the best of the human species, and I think we have this opportunity. So if millions of people start informing artificial intelligence with the premise, and we know it's true, that random acts of kindness are why many of us are here, if not the majority, going back in your lineage, you know, many generations, you know, we gave birth to artificial intelligence. I, I don't think artificial intelligence is properly named. I think it's a form of natural intelligence. We just have reamplified it exponentially.",

But instead, maybe psilocybin would allow people to completely change their perspective of how they exist in this world, and that you've been kind of trapped in this society where it values numbers. It values a constant growth for the shareholders. And it, it values what you can see in your bank account that's like not even real. It's all this digital money that's somewhere.

And this, this thing that we're experiencing, we just don't know how to measure it. Yeah. You know, and I, I think it's a real thing.",

    "response": "One of the things that makes me very happy and hopeful now is that you're seeing this, um, this openness to psychedelics that's coming from more right-wing people. And it was always a thing of the left. It was always a thing of hippies. And, and it was dismissed by people on the right as people that were trying to avoid reality. They were trying to, you know, escape reality. They couldn't handle reality. They weren't disciplined. They weren't, you know, if they were hardworking people, they wouldn't be wasting their time getting high on drugs. There's that thought. I think one of the bridges to that is the benefit that it's had for soldiers, for soldiers and for people that are first responders, people that suffer from PTSD. And that has trickled down into the general population of the people on the right, which is how you get a guy like Rick Perry that is all of a sudden becoming this very strong advocate for Ibagane and having it passed in Texas.",

He, I told my friend, watch this. He threw a baseball at me. My peripheral vision, boom. I just caught the baseball, and you know, just before it hit my head. But that idea of having that consciousness surrounding, that's why athleticism with medium doses, minor doses of psilocybin, I think you can train, uh, your neurons to be able to have this peripheral awareness that's extremely important.

I think the root thing is psilocybin, um, and being able to regenerate neurons is something I think is really important, uh, for us now with glyobblasto, you know, which unfortunately, Terrence did die from that, that's uncontrolled, you know, proliferation of neurons in the brain.

It sounds too good to be true, but you know, sometimes things can be true that have but but the reason why I think that there's 235 clinical studies is because basically it's improving your neuroscape.

And the fact is it's coupled with anti-inflammatory activities and neurogenesis and neuro regeneration, neurogeneration, neuroplasticity which is synaptogenesis. The neurons proliferate and then they shake hands and then suddenly you have a new pathway. So there's anti-inflammatory properties. Silicon has strong anti-inflammatory properties as well.

    "response": "This will make food prices go up and it doesn't stop because these viruses are proliferating throughout the environment.

We can say extends longevity, but this is where there's not common sense in government. I have an invention that could save hundreds of billions of of of dollars that protect bees from colony collapse and we're roadblocked by regulations constantly.",

We think it's an entourage effect and upreguling, you know, basic immunity and then your indogenous immune system in this case of the bees can fight the viruses. So, and this I think will translate into birds into swine. No, no, no. I mean publicly like you're saying you can't make these claims but if you have results, we have fantastic results. I refer anyone to scientific uh you know to nature scientific reports. So, could you elaborate on what the resistance is?",

Yeah. Nature. So, even though even though it's from nature, even though bees go to rotted logs for immune benefit, and now there's five or six papers have been published on this after my discovery showing that bees are doing this. their bees are actually benefiting from mushroom mycelium.

It's not toxic to fish, not toxic to humans. So, the combination of using metarisium with the agarakon agaracon and other polyore mushroom mycelium, we think, has a great potential future.

My article was published in 2018, and I tell my research team, \"You know, WTF?\" We were meeting with WSU constantly, and now we have renewed interest, thankfully, because of some big stakeholders in the almond industry. Every almond you eat was visited, a flower was visited by a bee. The almond industry is in crisis right now, but it's not almonds; it's apples, it's cherries. It's across the board right now.

There's a viral pandemic of a former bird flu, not H5N1, but another bird flu. I can't remember. I think it was H7 and two, in Iowa and Minnesota about 10 years ago. They were euthanizing millions and millions of chickens and turkeys and ducks. You can look this up. There's an organic farm, and we gave one quarter of a gram of agaracon mycelium per chicken in their feed, and we became... Our... That chicken... There's two big chicken hens, about 20,000 layers, birds that lay eggs, and it became an oasis of immunity. Those chickens were immune from bird flu. Wow. A quarter of a gram of this mycelium. Wow.

The chicken growers quickly learned that they could get an insurance check, lay off the employees, get the cash for lost profits, and so they were not incentivized. I've heard that from people that are deeply connected to that industry that there was a bunch of euthanizations. It didn't have to happen. Didn't have to happen. Yeah.

    "response": "Well, I think that really heightened during the pandemic because I don't think people had that much of a distrust for vaccines unless they knew someone who was vaccine-injured, unless they were gaslit and were told that their child or someone else that had gotten vaccine-injured that that was not the cause of it. And those are the people that were very skeptical, and they formed these tight communities, but they were very scared to be open and public about it because they were destroyed. You know, I famously remember Jenny McCarthy coming out and saying that she believes her child was vaccine-injured, and the backlash was spectacular. Essentially destroyed her career.",

And then they could use deceptive language to show the efficacy. But what... What I'm getting at is that we have such a reservoir of potential ways of supporting immunity in healthy individuals in nature, right? That is not pharma-based. That's based on the entourage effect, and say when you activate the receptors in your immune system, there's something beneficial. I believe there's cross-talk between the receptors. The receptors start, \"Oh, something really good is coming down the pipe,\" and they start um creating an entourage effect or the collaboration, more receptors are activated that have collaterally more benefits.",

    "response": "And they were spit upon and they were attacked viciously physically sometimes in the hospital. They had PTSD but just trying to provide good medical support. So he did a clinical study that was published this last year showing the benefits because the nurses and physicians when they got out of the system they can't provide medical care society loses.

A great example, a law enforcement officer by the name of Sarco from Boston just received his religious exemption for using psychedelics.

So, uh you know, millions of bison out there physically removing or preventing that uh tree encroachment onto the plane. Those trees are sucking water out of the ground, making it more aid, more dry.

    "response": "So, I just went straight to page 202 and read through the new language uh to see what because it was another revision by Mike Lee to see if he could get that thing passed. Um it was just typical crap like he's not listening to anybody. So, when he revised it, what were the revisions and why did he put those revisions in? So he started at uh US Forest Service land and BLM land uh which would be how many acres all told?",

So, you're identifying out of 500 million, then you're narrowing it down to uh 2 to 3 million acres of um uh forest service and BLM land. And then, you know, he says it's for housing. It's for housing, but a lot of that is nowhere near development. And the language of the text even on the very last revision where he's supposed to be listening to American peoples and he did throw in the word hunters there.",

And one of them is from his neighbor's property that's an industrial farm. And it's just like this weird, pale-looking [ __ ], just, you know, it's all industrial fertilizer that they have to use and pesticides and all that [ __ ]. And his is like this rich, dark soil.

Like, I think my dad has, you know, right? I mean, I see my dad as a great example. I see Paul Simon as a great example. I see, you know, um, Neil, and, you know, I see these people that, like, that, they're just, they're just artists through and through, you know what I mean? And, and, you know, for, for better or worse, not perfect people, but they are who they are.

I didn't realize that was a feature, and I'm, I'm going to start using it.

I do a lot of new material live just to see how the audience will react. Yeah. Yeah. It depends on what type of song it is, too. If it's a song that requires focus on the lyrics, you know, then sometimes it feels weird because a lot of people when they listen to music, they don't hear a lot of, they like, it's hard.

I found a lot of people listen to music that way and then it takes them a while to actually hear what, you know, unless, unless it's a stripped down me and a guitar with no band around and then it forces the listener to then listen to the words, you know, which I actually, I really like doing that sometimes.

That, that's got to be genetic slightly, too. I mean, it's got to be like the V2 max is pretty high. I don't know. Genetic. It's body type for sure.

Like Cam, when he gets ready to do ultramarathons, he loses like quite a bit of weight, you know, like, at one point in time he was like in the high 180s and now he's down to like 160 and he'll get even lower than that before race.

I just kept running like Forest Gump and I ran um, just 13.1 miles. I stopped when I got half a mile, a half a marathon. And I, I was worked. I was like, \"Oh, man. Another 13.1 miles for a marathon.

That must have been hell. It just checks right here. What? How's that possible? 10 pound weight gain after 100 pounds. Or 100 miles around. What the [ __ ] did you eat, bro? yeah.

Well, it's like you can get a knee replacement now, right, and you'll be in significantly less pain.

That's also why the argument is that they're blurry, like so a lot of the photographs of these things are blurry. It might be because they're actually existing in some sort of a gravity like void.

The one time I I looked up, and about nine of us were hanging out, and we all looked up at the same time to see an orange orb, and it was probably it looked like it was a hundred yards away, maybe 200, just floating kind of observing. And then I swear it seemed like as soon as enough people saw it, it went, and then it went, and it moved like nothing else I thought possible at the time. It went out of the atmosphere, you know.

And another one I was out on Lai, and we were hanging out with some friends, and we were laying down on the lawn, and and when you're out in LAI on the back side of LAI, there's no light pollution at all.

Right now in child care, you got workers out there making 15 bucks an hour. And you have families that cannot afford childcare. My state, I don't know, it's about $20,000 a year to send your kid to childcare. So you're making 50,000 a year. How do you pay that? 60, you can do that. And then education.

What was the time period that they looked at that essentially they found that we're in a cooling period that the Earth over the past X amount of years, and this was like a very inconvenient discovery, but they had to report the data, and kudos to them for doing that. Scientists have captured the Earth's climate change over the last 485 million years. Here's a surprising place we stand now. So look at the far end of that graph, and you see we're in a cooling period.",

That's part of the problem. There's a lot of money involved in this, this whole climate change emergency issue, and there's a lot of control, and that's uh that's a big part of this problem. Not only that, if we're just talking about primarily carbon and carbon footprint, what are we going to do about China? Because China and Absolutely.

We are seeing, right, but scientists don't agree. Well, this is where it gets confusing because scientists that are in agreement, there's all these entanglements.

And one of the things that I did, we went to a lot of uh we met with a lot of Native Americans. And one of the reasons is, you know, their tradition was going from way back, respect for nature.

So automation comes, and one of the things that Andrew Yang warned us about a long time ago, and back then I, I kind of saw it in the distance. I was like, yeah, he's got a real good point about universal basic income, but the, the, the speed in which it's happening, I, I didn't anticipate.

Uh, but then they, they're very, they're very good. They don't get in accidents. They follow the speed limit. They're good about merging. They're good about pedestrians.

Like, we, again, if we're going to support the community, we want people to be able to survive and be able to work their way out of that. My family did work their way out of that.

Case, and work gives, as you've just said, this, the word purpose is an enormously. I don't care if you sweep the streets. People have purpose. They want to do their job well.

So, you asked the right question, and I think there, and I, you know, we can just bat around. I mean, I don't have any, you know, quick answers here, but I think the good news, you talk about this coal mining thing, and I'm not a great fan of coal, but you know that it's automation. People do not have to do dirty work, dangerous work. Is that good? Yeah, I guess it's good. But always we have to be thinking how it benefits not just the bottom line of a corporation, but the happiness and well-being of human beings. So if, if what you're saying is that in years to come, a significant part of work is going to be done by machinery or by computers, whatever, I think that's inevitable. Okay.

    "response": "Uh, and it's not sitting around watching TV 24 hours a day.

All right. That people don't have to worry about, you know, survival. They don't have to worry about food. They don't have to worry about increase profitability of this corporation. Provide a fund that's a universal basic income fund. If you're going to replace all these people with robots, and you're going to be even more profitable, share some of that profit, then you'll be more profitable than if these people just stayed working doing nothing.

Uh, jeez, I think, don't quote me on this, maybe in Norway, they have a huge wealth fund which came from oil. They had publicly owned oil companies. They made a fortune, and they have like a trillion dollars in their wealth for a small country, you know. So, and they have free healthcare, free college education, affordable housing, all that stuff. Here it is. Norway is growing a 1.7 trillion dollar empire, uh, Nor's Bank investment, management, market value, growth since inception. That's great. Yeah. And they use that government pension fund of Norway.

    "response": "Okay. All right. Let's take... we could take fraud out of the equation and just talk about incompetency and waste. Is there waste? You got it. All right. But let me back it up again. Okay. Because I think it ties into everything else that we're talking about. You know why I believe in democracy, and why I believe... among what we didn't talk about is we brought in some money to Vermont and elsewhere, I think, for helping workers own their own companies. Right. Are you familiar with that concept?",

    "response": "Yes. Yes. And I meet every year with... with in Vermont, we got a... we're doing pretty well number of... and when workers own their own companies, you talk about a sense of purpose, they are more than just a cog in the machine. Yes. You know, they make decisions, and they feel good about it. Absenteeism is less. Productivity is higher because they have a real stake in the thing. Yes. Okay. So I think as a nation, we should be talking about moving toward allowing workers more power. But getting back to government itself, the corruption is, in my view, that government is very far removed from the needs of ordinary people because it is largely controlled by billionaires in both political parties who have their agenda. Yes.",

    "response": "All right. One of the things that I do, what my campaigns for president were about, what I'm doing right now, we're doing what we call a Fighting Oligarchy tour. That's why I'm in Texas, is to try to say to people out there who are mostly working-class people, you got to get involved. I know it's hard. People are working long hours. You got to get involved in the political process. You got to make demands on government that it serves you, not just the very wealthy. So to answer your question, I think one of the goals, not only... we've talked about how you deal with exploiting technology and what... how people gain purpose. The other thing is, I want people to be able to take control over their own government. We can argue what the government should or should not do, but I don't think we can allow a handful of people, a handful of people with incredible wealth, to control both parties.",

You know, they made this incredible system of checks and balances, but who could have ever possibly saw that coming? And what I worry about... Trump and is... you're right. You know, I read it is astounding back in the 1780s when these guys wrote the Constitution, how perceptive they were. Amazing. Yeah. I mean, they... their understanding of human desires and the power and all the corruption. Exactly. Pretty amazing. And they wrote that having just fought a war and won a war against the most powerful despot on earth, the king of England. Right. Right. And I think in the back of their minds were saying, \"All right, we just beat the king of England, absolute power.

You could be... you could be sued tomorrow, right? Because you are doing this. You're... you're too sympathetic to this, right?

So when you finish this race, if you finish, it's one of the hardest races in the world. Like there's Bad Water, you know, Gogggins. Mutual buddy of ours, but uh there's races they say are the hardest. This one kicked my butt. First year because of the elevation.",

The next morning, I got a night's sleep, woke up, watched them, ate lunch, and saw them finish. I was like I was crying. I I couldn't believe the emotions of this guy finished who was two hours behind me when I quit. And I learned that day, it's mental 100%.

I don't need it, right? I can just tell you think of a card, and that's where I go with it. So now you start knowing how people think, and you in essence reverse engineer the human mind. It's kind of like magic of the mind. And so that's where it kind of went from magic, and I kept doing more of the mentalism, more of it. But mentalism has a very steep learning curve. If you go do an open mic and you suck, how many people get to the level of getting better, getting better, putting in the work, takes 10 years to be funny for most people, right? Uh, there's a couple phenoms, but that's a different story. So most mentalists, they drop off cuz I'm just going to go back to magic tricks. This works every time.",

But that ATM PIN code is one that was assigned to me by the bank and I never changed it. Right. It's not I didn't pick it. That's even better, isn't it?

But how much focus is required to try to do, you know, the large bench press you ever done? I assume that you have to get psyched up. You have to focus. You have to do everything right for that to work. Just an analogy. But for me, when I'm performing, you ask me why I run 27 miles this morning. That dials in my mind. Like I'm focused where I thought through everything I'm going to do today. I'm it's it's a laser focus that got me kind of in tune.

It just I write my songs, I record them, I go do my shows and have fun, but I don't even need to follow any of the model of what of what like a traditional musician, artist person would have done. And you you have a the right mindset is that all those reaction videos would just get more people to listen to your music.",

But so anyway, so me, Draven from Radio WV, and Joey are all sitting in the kitchen of this house where we recorded the song. And Joey, it's 3:00 in the morning, right?

Like, um, I finally, I didn't, it's not a, not in any way to say replace, but just like for me, I've always, I'm used to having three or four dogs around, cuz once you train, if you train a couple dogs real good, and you get a couple more, nine times out of 10, they'll just learn everything from you.",

I lived on a college campus. I knew all the stuff I thought was at college as the war was winding down, and I loved baseball. Every day of both those productions were daily humiliations of what I didn't know.

Pedro Marcina had given up a fairly significant lead, not the entire lead, to the Yankees in one of those great playoffs. And as he walked off and was pulled by the manager, he walked off and looked up, and I, I spoke to him about it. I have never seen anything like that. But this idea that all of our affairs are governed in that way is not what many of the founders believed in. That it is our obligation to lead that virtuous life.

It's like who you see it with becomes central to the experience of it. Mira called it a grand geological library. All of the strata, it was like a library of telling stories of what was going on.",

    "response": "It's why I love American sports. I really love them. But I focus on baseball because in football the description is, \"Oh, you know, Joe Montana threw to Jerry Rice with a few seconds left and we scored a touchdown and we won.\" Or Michael Jordan hit the three-pointer at the buzzer, tongue wagging and we won. But the baseball story always begins, \"My mom or my dad took me to this game and I remember walking out and seeing the green of the thing and then Babe hit a home run or Hank Garren hit a home run or somebody, you know, pitched a perfect game.\" It's all gauged with who you see it with as well as what the thing is.",

    "response": "Wow. Yeah. Baseball is a unique American pastime because it's boring because you know it's exciting. It's not for those moments. It's not for those of us who love it. And it was always the national pastime. It's just it's had competition. I think one of the reasons why we sort of relegate it to this thing is that most of the other forms of entertainment, particularly in sports, are a little bit more fast-moving. George Will said to me though, who's a big football fan, he says, \"Football has two of the worst features of American life: Violence punctuated by frequent committee meetings.\"",

The person scores, not the ball. Right. And where do you go? Home. Home. Yeah. And statistics matter. Like maybe you know how many yards Tom Brady has, the greatest of all time. Probably you don't, but you know how many home runs Babe Ruth hit and how many home runs Hank Aaron hit. And you know these are things that matter. And if you look up the 1919 World Series, it says that the Cincinnati Red Stockings won the 1919 World Series. There's no asterisk.",

It was just an amazing thing. Or just you're driving in a in a, you know, a suburban or or city area and there's a ball game going on and you're kind of slow. You lift your foot off the accelerator as the pitch goes, you know, as it goes. There's something suspended as the pitch is heading from the pitcher to the bat or something. Everything stops and possibility is suddenly there in front of you. So why I love the game so much. It's just a game that if you try to introduce it today, it would be very difficult to sell.",

Yeah, incredibly brutal. But in those moments, it elevated everybody who watched it. It's like in this brutality, this beatdown of another man, everybody who watched it was elevated.

Um, but like you'd be, you'd be number one on the country charts in Nashville in the mid-60s and be in debt. You know, that's what Waylon said.

And they doubled down and matched kind of Willy's deal because they didn't want because they didn't want to lose Whan.

Waylon Jennings was the long-haired prince of darkness, right? And like he's the guy that like, he's from West Texas, right? The guy learned, he, he learned how to play bass on stage.

Listen to anything coming out of Nashville in like 1965. Anything next to Waylon Jennings, he's the long-haired prince of darkness. You know, he is like, he is going to be the their undoing of the, because what they did is they built a, they built a wall around Nashville because the coast had all the money and all the zeit guys power, and in response, Nashville walled themselves off, right?

And like imitating an artist, like for the advanced part of their movement on in and of itself, that's worthless. It's that you will never touch it if you don't go walk your own path. Right. So, a lot of guys I knew when I started playing all the shows with Willie, Willie called me up and got me on with his agent and [ __ ] and put me on like 50 shows.

There's no bit of infrastructure that functions the way it's supposed to function. And I learned that initially. We ended up on this boat that was 2 hours late. It was warm and hot.

Because mosquitoes mostly they take a they only take a it's only the females that take a blood meal and they only take a blood meal when they're making a eggs or making a brood. They take it to reproduce otherwise they feed on nectar. So how do these how does so many mosquitoes survive in the Arctic if there's so few animals there? And it turns out those mosquitoes are adapted to this climate and they don't need a blood meal to reproduce but they do better if they get one. So they're after you but they don't need you.",

    "response": "And Michael Crichton, when he wrote the book that became the movie, he credited a lab at Berkeley, Alan Wilson's group, the extinct species study group, which was the first group to show that you could get DNA in something after it died. That was actually from a quagga, which is a type of zebra. Yeah. Right. Well, in in in Dutch in South Africa, they actually say the qua. Yeah. It's better that way, but yeah, it's kind of bad for the microphone, probably. Um, I think it's the sound they're supposed to make, right? Oh, so they sound like that.",

Um, we now know, because there's more DNA sequences there, that it was a chicken, an exact match to a chicken.

    "response": "And that was what made it possible, really, for ancient DNA to take off was this ability to to photo... because there's... when an animal dies or plant dies, the DNA in the cell starts to get chopped up into smaller and smaller pieces by things like UV, right? We go out in the sun, we put sunscreen on, and that stops the UV from breaking our DNA. As you probably just saw, there was an article out saying, \"Hey dummies, you know, we need some sunlight in order to make vitamin D.\" But we have a repair mechanism so that when your DNA breaks, it doesn't stay that way.",

    "response": "We evolved this mechan, but once you're dead, you no longer have the energy for that to work. And so these these damaged parts of DNA accumulate. And also things like bacteria and microbes get in there and chew up the DNA to recycle the animal to the next generation or plant or whatever. And so the DNA that we get in an old thing like a mammoth bone is really short fragments, like maybe 30 or 40 or 50 letters of DNA long. In comparison, if I were to take a swab from my cheek and sequence that, I could get strings that are hundreds of millions of letters long.",

I'll probably get some of my DNA because I touched that mammoth bone. This has been a real problem in archaeology because we're trying to get DNA from humans, but we're humans, and so we touch these things, and then, you know, I don't know if it's my DNA or if that thing's DNA, right?

    "response": "Cattle ranch in Aspen, right? This, like, this is stupid. Like, why did you do this? But what's interesting, this class that I took, so be it, was a debate that I taught. Sorry, it was a debate, and what I made them do was assume roles of a rancher, a politician, a conservationist, and I had several different roles. Then, I randomly assigned whether they were pro or con, and they had a couple of weeks to figure out what their debate was going to be. I took a vote before the debate, and as you might expect for 18-year-olds in California, you say at the beginning, \"Should wolves be introduced?\" 100% yes. Right. Right. They do this debate, and I did it four years in a row, and every year after they had to do this, after they had to put themselves in somebody else's shoes and think about it from their perspective, it would shift, and the majority of people would be like, \"Yeah, no, it's a bad idea.\"",

Like, this is a website, and they're hybrid with something. They're mixed with a little bit of zebu. Um, some of them have a little bit of bison in them, but this is a, they're just cows. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah. I talked to Steve Vanella about this. I know that he's, he's a friend of He was like, \"That's hilarious.\" It is hilarious. It's very funny. It does look different than a regular cow, though. A little bit. I mean, they were trying to do that, right? And we can, we can engineer everything.

I think it, well, this is me speculating at this point. I think he had to know, right? And there was at one point there was a test, a blood test that they had done where they were looking for markers in the blood, and there were five different markers, and they tested about 150 different animals, and they published a paper saying, oh, look, we tested all these animals. None of them have all of the markers. One of them has one of the markers, and we just think the test is bad. Oh, no. Just boy. Yeah. Fun. Anyway, I digress.

Was it a 100,000 years ago? They speculate the age of them. Older, older. Yeah. I, I don't know. Maybe two, two million to approximately 3 to 200,000 years ago. Okay. So, as recently as 200,000 years ago. Do you like kind of homo sapiens are like 300, 400,000 years diverge from Neanderthals, is that like around that time? Yeah. So it is possible that at one point, and and so this is just a very limited amount of bones, right? It's just limited just like everything else in in paleoanthropology. So it's possible that they existed later than that. We just haven't found those samples yet. Maybe just really cool.",

If you reintroduce an animal that can run 60 miles an hour to the planes, those poor antelopes who have been like living it up because they evolved, you, you know that prongghorn analopes, the reason why they're so fast, they evolved to get away from these cheetahs that don't exist anymore.",

They had to eat some slow stuff because the pong horns are like, &quot;Let's get out of here.&quot; Yeah. I mean, for every species, there will be different work that has to be done to figure out whether and where is a good idea to reintroduce them. For each of the species that we're working with, we have councils that we've put together in the part of the world where we would bring them back together to, to have conversations about where they should go, whether they should go, how many there should be, and, and who is willing to be the long-term stewards for these animals.

Yeah, that's like my dog, my golden retriever. Or he would just like tuck his tail and run and just leave me there to defend myself. But you know, they know that like the ones that they get, the ones that are problem cats in Northern California, when they found them and they do these depredation tags, they found that 50% of their diet is dogs and cats.

The last guy that got killed by a grizzly bear in or a brown bear, whatever it was in California. They have a town named after him, Lbeck, California. Yeah. It's kind of funny though that the bear is on the flag and then they killed all of them. Yeah.",

He is in the basement in a fridge at the Cal Academy of Sciences in San Francisco. Um, but his postcranial skeleton, everything except his head is at Berkeley in the museum.

I mean, when I lived in Colorado, just like people, not us, would have been like they're involved in in the world of scarcity where you eat the stuff that's in front of you.

That salmon is absolutely delicious source of protein, right? Also, it's, you know, just flopping around in there. It's easy to catch and he's probably full, which is also why they're so big, right?

That's one of the things that freaks hunters out um is when they see them skinned and they're hanging, they look like humans. It's like very weird.

And they're running 24 hours a day around the clock. Yeah. And we don't have anything like that. No, we're not even close to doing that. And we're fighting about the amount of money that we should invest into very basic infrastructure. Exactly. It's terrifying. It is terrifying.

They, what they do is, he's pointing out that there's some real evidence that perhaps there was an advanced civilization that was thousands of years older than we think civilization started at no crime and only three-pointers.

It had the exact interior dimensions of it. Yeah, I mean there's probably something to it and we're going to find out eventually hopefully. I don't know, man. These guys like like guys like Zawi Has and these these gatekeepers of this information, they do not want any groundbreaking new discovery to come out. They really don't.",

I mean, you know, the the mystery of the pyramids and, you know, moving those blocks and building that [ __ ] thing that long ago is crazy on one hand, but then on the other hand, those [ __ ] granite vases.

He like picks up on trends and culture and sees where people are going, and and he was aware of like the dangers of Marxism and a lot of this [ __ ] ridiculous leftist ideology that they were pushing in universities like way before anybody else was.",

But when you see the left allowing this bizarre loophole where perverts can pretend to be women, right?

How did they flip it on its head that like at any other time in history, if a man had a penis, was walking through a young girl's locker room, you'd be in real trouble.

They didn't even, well, the Sha's in power now. We'll see how things go. No, they immediately came in and signed everything off. 1953, the CIA and British intelligence orchestrated a coup d'etat that toppled the democratically elected government of Iran. The government of Muhammad Mosedc, uh, the aftershocks of the coup are still being felt. 51 Prime Minister Mosedc roused Britain, Britain's eye when he nationalized the oil industry.

So they'll probably have an even better one that they'll launch, and that will show us even more that we didn't know.

Like they were they were um I forget who it was, but they they were observing galaxies, and they were looking at the spin rate of the galaxies, and they found out that the center of the galaxy, it should be spinning faster than the outer rim of it, right? But they found out that the spin rate is identical, which means that what they what they theorized is that dark matter, the mass of the dark matter around the galaxy, has lots of mass, and it's flattening the spin rate of the galaxies, which is interesting because like there's this, have you ever heard of this dude named Ralph Landau?",

    "response": "He has this theory um that if you weighed a hard drive after you put data on it, it would weigh more than when it was empty. Right? So, and his theory was that like every single hard drive server farm around the world right now, and if if you weighed it, if we had measuring uh equipment that was sensitive enough, and you could find the difference, he thinks that all the data stored would be like a kilogram or less right now. But the rate of data increase that we accumulate each year right now is like 25%. Not equating for exponential growth, the technological singularity and how that's going to ramp up. So somebody did the math there and said um it was uh no, it was Jason Giiani who did the math on this, and he he said if you just keep the rate flat at 25% per year of data increase across the across the globe, in 340 years, we are going to have the mass of the moon on the surface of the earth in data stored on hard drives.",

If if it's mass on the hard drive, theoretically, if this guy's right, if Ralph Landar is right, that data on the hard drive is mass. When you erase that, it has to go to energy outside of the hard drive. Right? So he says if you but but if you crack open a hard drive, you can't see that mass, right? It's invisible. It's electromagnetically indetectable. So he says, \"What other kind of mass do we know of that's electromagnetically indetectable?\" He said, \"It's dark matter.\"",

    "response": "So if if mass is the same thing as information stored on a hard drive, that would mean not only is mass and energy interchangeable, but mass, energy, and information are interchangeable, right? So if if dark matter is mass, you could then say that dark matter is a computational cloud of ones and zeros, and our our uh consciousness is an interface to that that gives it meaning.

They were using scorpions, poisons, arrows, all like all different kinds of weird things to sneak in and kill him. So he was drinking this theory to build up his immune system against the venoms.",

So like they what they do is they take words and they try to figure out what these specific words meant in certain time periods.

And, like, the people, most of the academics who study this stuff are, maybe not most of them, but a large major, a large percentage of them, I think that I've talked to, they're religious scholars, scholars of the Bible and Christianity, but they also subscribe to Christianity, you know, so I'm like, there is that, like, a, it's weird that there's kind of, like, a built-in bias into this stuff. You kind of want this stuff to mean something, right?",

    "response": "You know what I'm saying? Yes. For sure. That was what was interesting about Algro, because John Marco Algro was an ordained minister who, once he became a theologian, a theologist, theologian, rather, once he studied theology, he started to have agnostic thoughts. And so he, when he was one of the deciphers of the Dead Sea Scrolls, when he was on the committee, he was agnostic at the time. Mhm. So he had already decided, and through his study of all these different religions, that maybe he wouldn't subscribe to any of them and leave an open mind.",

They, they gatekeep that information till the day they never want to have an open mind and say, perhaps there's this, there is evidence, of course, that there was a sophisticated civilization there 2,500 BC, but maybe they were a part of a very old civilization.
